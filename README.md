# Hi, I'm Borbaana Suvaan 👋

I'm a third-year B.Sc. student in **Mechanics and Mathematical Modeling** at  
**I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University**.  
My interests lie in **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)**, **numerical methods for PDEs**,  
**compressible flows**, and **mathematical modeling of biological systems**.

I enjoy building clean numerical solvers, experimenting with high-resolution schemes,  
and studying nonlinear wave phenomena in physics and biology.
